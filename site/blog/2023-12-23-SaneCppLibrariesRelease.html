          </p>
          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            So...where do I even start? <br>
            This is probably just an articulation of my multi-decade old opinion on
            <code>How should C++ be written</code>&trade; that nobody has ever asked for ü§≠.<br>

          <h6>Modern C++ and Standard C++ Library</h6>
          I find Modern C++ style problematic üò©, causing large increases in compile time and binary
          size, frequent confusion caused to code completion engines, and micro-heap-allocations habits engraved in
          a mountain of hard-to-understand code.<br>
          Many of these (and other) problems are not easily avoidable when using the <i>Standard C++ Library</i>,
          making it too easy descending into an endless hole of growing complexity.<br>

          <h6>Handmade C</h6>
          On the other side of the spectrum I observe so many <i>proudly handmade</i> developers sticking to C or
          coming up with new languages sharing similar minimalistic spirit.<br>
          I'm definitively more spiritually affine to readable and well written C üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, rather than Modern C++.<br>
          I often feel however that such libraries are rare (<code>sqlite</code>, <code>sokol</code>,
          <code>stb</code>, <code>raylib</code> etc.) and it takes a lot of discipline and experience to stick
          successfully to such clean and coherent style.<br>
          </p>

          <h3>Other languages and libraries</h3>
          <p>
            Many programming languages come with a standard library designed to solve common user needs.<br>
            That's not the case for C++ though, where any non trivial project will have to integrate
            <i>third party libraries</i> to do anything significant.<br>
            Integrating such libraries morphs C++ projects into a patchwork of incoherent programming styles,
            as direct derivation of the subset of language features chosen by the authors.<br>
            Sometimes these incoherences become actual bad practices producing hard to read and maintain code, bugs,
            instabilities, inefficiencies and security issues.<br>
          </p>

          <h3>The holy <i>hidden subset</i> of C++</h3>
          <p>
            This project is a journey of defining and discovering a C++ subset that makes writing code with it enjoyable
            üòå.
            Libraries should be working harmonically with each other while still making it possible to use them in
            isolation or with minimum inter-dependencies.<br>
            This holy hidden C++ subset should encourage writing readable programs that are efficient and fast to
            compile while still being easy to develop / debug / deploy and reasonably safe on multiple platforms.<br>
            The edit / recompile cycle should ideally be closer to the ones of <i>highly productive</i> languages
            like Python and Javascript than the average C++ project / library.
          </p>

          <h3>Defining the scope</h3>
          <p>
            So what is the initial scope of the library?
          <h6>Basic building blocks</h6>
          The very first basic building blocks are a good API for: async IO / networking, file system and process
          handling, serialization, text (with utf support), json and http.
          <h6>Data structures and algorithms</h6>
          Data structures and algorithms are for now secondary, but the library comes with a solid
          <code>Vector T</code> implementation with support for custom inline storage
          <code>SmallVector T, N</code>.
          Proper arena allocation / release strategies will be explored too.
          <h6>User Interfaces</h6>
          User interfaces abstraction are excluded (for now).<br>
          Once most of the libraries will be in <i>MVP</i> or <i>Stable</i> the topic will be revisited.
          <h6>Integrations</h6>
          It's very important showing how to integrate libraries inside such system specific GUI libraries /
          toolkits.<br>
          For example it could be not obvious how to properly integrate the Async IO event loop inside a GUI event
          loop. Providing ready-made examples for such setups is going to be very useful to many users of the libraries.
          <h6>Self-hosted build system</h6>
          An optional to use build system, where build files are written in imperative C++ code (compiled on the fly) is
          being worked on. The build system links the rest of library compiled as a single unity build.
          </p>

          <h3>Some rules</h3>
          <p>
            Some rules used in the project:
          <ul>
            <li>Libraries will not use C++ standard library at all.</li>
            <li>Libraries will not need a build system to be integrated in existing projects.</li>
            <li>Libraries will not increase build time when integrated into existing projects.</li>
            <li>Libraries will compile free of warnings on all major C++ compilers (Clang, GCC, MSVC).</li>
            <li>Libraries will try to avoid heap allocation and make efforts to let caller handle such memory.</li>
            <li>Libraries will have proper tests and documentation.</li>
            <li>Libraries will focus on common use cases rather than trying to cover every possible use case.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Dependencies</h3>
          <p>
            General advice is to avoid using 3rd party libraries as much as possible.<br>
            <br>
            There are some cases where it's simply unreasonable not using any third party library.<br>
            Windows and macOS native APIs are being leveraged to avoid needing libraries (a good example is the
            <code>Hashing</code> library).<br>
            On Linux however some of these API are not part of the kernel, are typically part of user-space
            libraries. Such libraries will need to be installed with <code>apt-get</code> or delivered by wrapping some
            3rd party dependency.<br><br>

            In any case if 3rd party libraries will be used, they will be made optional and properly wrapped in
            a way that they will be an hidden implementation detail.<br>
            Building the library will still not require a build system and it will still be fast to compile.<br>
            No derogation will be made to these principles.
          </p>

          <h3>Maturity</h3>
          <p>
            The project is being open-sourced in its very early stages.<br>
            Libraries have different level of maturity, stated in the documentations with a brief roadmap.<br>
            As of today, when this post is written, they're mostly in <i>Draft</i> or <i>MVP</i> state.<br>
            No guarantee is being done for API stability too for now.
          </p>

          <h3>Platforms</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, the only supported platforms are macOS and Windows.<br>
            A partial port to Emscripten / WebAssembly is also being worked on.<br>
            Linux support is one explicit bullet point in the roadmap of all libraries that use OS specific API.<br>
            Compatibility on iOS will be explored too.<br>
          </p>

          <h3>Licensing</h3>
          <p>
            The project is MIT licensed, so it should make things easy for any potential adopter.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusions</h3>
          <p>
            It'll be fun! üòé
